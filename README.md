# Spam_Email_Detector

Introduction:
For this project I am going to work with a dataset that has contents of emails and are labeled either spam or not spam. Using TensorFlow, a machine learning platform, I plan on developing an accurate classification algorithm to determine whether or not an email is spam or not. Using TensorFlow's ability to process and transform textual data, we will be able to train the model and come up with an accurate classification of the emails. The model will learn the typical contents in a spam email to correctly identify a spam email versus a regular email.

Dataset: Email Spam Classfication Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purusinghvi/email-spam-classification-dataset)

Methodology:
1. Preprocess the text data using TensorFlow Tokenizer.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Design a neural network for text classification.
4. Train the model
5. Check models accuracy
6. Optimize the model for greater accuracy and keep repeating until the model
   has a good accuracy identifying the emails.

3 Questions to Answer:
1. What patterns or words contribute in the decision of a spam email vs a normal email?
2. What textual clues or content does the email contain for the model to determine wheter it's spam or not
3. How will the model deal with speacial characters and how would that influence the classification of the email?
